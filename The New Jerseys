I know many people in FOSS community and they think that will be the cure for everything too. Some of these people are the best coders I have ever worked with but yeah no company will "open their code to all" cause then they have no more business. Even in modern socialist countries that does not work at all. People, even smart people, love their utopian pipe dreams. Those same people push linux non stop but the kernel is like half binary blobs now and not open source just for driver and hardware needs

Anyone else prefer the Tracer Tong's plan ending for Deus Ex?

​@Sardious None of what you said, about technology is accurately true... but If you don't believe me, teach yourself to code and start building alternatives. Don't Wait! for someone else to do it make sense? You'll get Rich too btw. Look at Red Hat? How many $Billions were they acquired for? If you understand newer business models, their a "100% Open source company, but Closed knoledge bases & Revenues from Service Contracts" absolutely does work. I have used all manner of their software in production for 12 years. Not even theirs! the community versions.

Btw, Half or more of the code AT These tech companies is already open source!

https://opensource.facebook.com/
https://twitter.github.io/

Google in fact runs it's entire infrastructure on (Heavily) customized debian. And has added stuff to the kernel which never existed before:

And on blobs creep? It's largely a solved problem. I have exactly 0 blobs, on a Core i7 & Nvidia gpu. The only real instigators now are NVIDIA & Arm (licensees) An ordinary user who's not a gamer? largely unaffected by it. Enterprise hw on the other hand Does have blobs problem!

Ian's perspective was from being the only Non-technical cofounder of minds, starting that, yet having enough insight & understanding to know where the futures' going. Subverse.net was a Minds site. They did not release their code for 5 years. They started in 2010ish.


Open vs. Closed & Proprietary vs. Non-Profit? are not entirely oppositional. You can have companies that do all 4, (or Subsidiaries) and succeed tremendously.. precisely because of that combination. P.S. What Elon Musk did with releasing all his automotive patents? (so others could "catch up") was also akin to that.
